# 📚 Implementing Open LLM Models with JAX and Flax

This repository is part of my proposal for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 under the [JAX organization](https://github.com/google/jax). The goal of this project is to create clean, educational implementations of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) using **JAX** and **Flax**.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to implement open LLM architectures in JAX and Flax and make them accessible through well-documented code and usage notebooks. These implementations are meant to serve as high-quality references for researchers, developers, and learners working with JAX.

---

## 📌 Deliverables

- ✅ Educational implementations of selected open-source LLMs using JAX + Flax
- ✅ Clear, modular code with comments and explanations
- ✅ Example notebooks showing training, inference, and usage
- ✅ Support for loading and testing with pretrained weights (where available)

---

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Working with JAX and Flax has transformed how machine learning research is done at scale. However, high-quality reference implementations of LLMs are still sparse. This project aims to bridge that gap by focusing on:

- Clarity over complexity
- Reproducibility
- Educational value

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m an undergraduate student with a deep interest in deep learning, especially model internals and efficiency. I’ve worked on both image and audio classification pipelines, built custom CNNs, and am currently exploring generative models using 3D U-Nets and factorized attention. You can learn more about me from the [proposal PDF](./GSOC_Proposal.pdf) included in this repo.
